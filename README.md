# Vertisan Nebula SDK for .NET : Version 1.0
This project provides client tools and/or utilities in .NET that makes it easy to interact with the Vertisan Nebula platform. The Vertisan Nebula SDK is published in [nuget](https://nuget.org) under the name Vertisan.Nebula.SDK.Core.  

## Targets .NET Standard 2.0

We've unified our existing .NET and .NET Core SDKs into a single .NET SDK, which targets .NET Standard 2.0. This means you can now use the .NET SDK in both your .NET Framework 4.6.1+ and .NET Core 2.0+ applications.
